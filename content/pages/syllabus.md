Description

This course is an introduction to labor economics with an emphasis on applied microeconomic theory and empirical analysis. We are especially interested in the link between research and public policy. Topics to be covered include: labor supply and demand, taxes and transfers, minimum wages, immigration, human capital, education production, inequality, discrimination, unions and strikes, and unemployment.

Prerequisites
-------------

Prerequisites include basic-to-intermediate microeconomics and a course in statistics or econometrics. Also helpful is some experience with statistical computing, ideally using Stata or SAS.

Course Requirements
-------------------

In addition to exams and [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings), there are four problem sets, each of which have a computer-exercise component. There are also ungraded review problem sets at the beginning and the end of the course. Students are expected to participate in class discussions.
